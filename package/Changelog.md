2. il2cpp optimization feature no longer requires static library linking on Android (unsupported by some Unity versions)
3. il2cpp-generated wrapper code no longer needs to be separately compiled into plugins
4. il2cpp supports zero-GC reflection
5. QuickJS backend and Mult backend now support il2cpp optimization
6. Simplified compilation for QuickJS backend and Mult backend by directly integrating quick-ng source code compilation
7. Fixed compound type ref passing from C# to JS in il2cpp optimization, resolving #1886
8. Enabled il2cpp optimization by default for all platforms except iOS and WebGL during il2cpp packaging

## [2.1.1] - 2024-10-25
1. Disable JIT on the HarmonyOS platform.
2. Compatibility with higher versions of V8.
3. Upgrade QuickJS to the latest version.
4. V8 backend, add WebSocket support to QuickJS.
5. Add support for lazy loading and automatic unloading in the CJS implementation.

3. Feature: Allow puer.getLastException to retrieve errors from ExecuteModule (#1686).
4. Optimization: Refactor quickjs's esm to prevent the mixed use of quickjs api and v8 api in the same function, improving the previous situation where esm was heavily dependent on a certain version of quickjs backend, which prevented the upgrade of quickjs backend. Also, upgrade quickjs backend.

6. New concept `LazyBinding`：
    In 1.3- when you write `return false` in filter for some c# member. That member will still do TypeRegist by reflection could be call during runtime.
    Now, this feature will still work. But that kind of member will do reflection during first invoke but not during TypeRegister.
 8. New form of `filter`
     To compat with the new `LazyBinding` mode. `Filter` now can not only return a boolean but can return a `BindingMode`. Which is a enum inculde `FastBinding` (means will generate static wrapper)、`LazyBinding` (mentioned above)、`DontBinding` (can not be called during runtime)。you can find an example in `U2018Compatible.cs`
